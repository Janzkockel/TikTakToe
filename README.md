# Tik Tak Toe

## What for is this projekt?
This Projekt if for the school. We have to do a Projekt as preperation for the IPA. It takes 1 semester.

## What is my projekt about?
I am doing an online Tik Tak Toe, which you can reached under the url https://pig-comic-heron.ngrok-free.app (the server might not be online). In addition to that I am doing an hardware Tik Tak Toe wich you can play from against the online users.

## How does the server Work?
The server runs with Python Flask and does not direktly run in the public network. To connect with the Public Network I did not open a Port instead it uses ngrok. Ngrok is Tunnel service which transfers the data from inside the port to the client.

## How does the game algorithm work?
The game is a normal Tik Tak Toe (3 wins). It is written in JavaScript and is written troughout multiple files. The main file is script.js. The game calculations runs on the frontend mainly in buttonsControll.js.
